To make things more complicated than they should be, especially for MTB riders, tyre manufacturers often overstate their tyre sizes. For example, a tyre stated to be 2.4” will often measure 2.2”. If that's the case, please go for the CLUG mtb (rather than the CLUG mtb XL) as you will appreciate the snugger fit. The easiest way to measure tyre width is with callipers.",

Have a look on our CLUG page to work out which size CLUG you need. If your tyre states its 2.3” or 2.4” then it will very likely have an actual size of around 2.2” and we strongly recommend you opt for the CLUG mtb size.",

              "faq_question_1": "What is CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_1": "CLUG is the world’s smallest bike rack and works with your floor to store your bike. You can CLUG vertically or horizontally.",
              "faq_question_2": "Which size CLUG do I need?",
              "faq_desc_2": "The critical measurement is your ACTUAL tyre width. Armed with this measurement pick CLUG with the appropriate range. To make things more complicated than they should be, especially for MTB riders, tyre manufacturers often overstate their tyre sizes. For example, a tyre stated to be 2.4” will often measure 2.2”. If that's the case, please go for the CLUG mtb (rather than the CLUG mtb XL) as you will appreciate the snugger fit. The easiest way to measure tyre width is with callipers. To watch a video on how to measure, click here.",
              "faq_question_3": "How is it best to store my bike using CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_3": "CLUG is built to store your bike in two ways. The first way is to store it vertically. The second way is to store it horizontally. To store vertically roll your bike up so it’s on its back wheel. Once it is lined up vertically beneath the CLUG, push the front wheel into the CLUG. You cannot CLUG a bike vertically with the front wheel on the floor because the front wheel will twist and the bike will fall down! To store horizontally roll your rear tyre (backwards) into the CLUG, making sure the bike is perfectly straight. You cannot CLUG a bike horizontally with the front wheel in the CLUG because the front wheel will twist.",
              "faq_question_4": "Can CLUG hang my bike in the air? Can the wheels be off the ground?",
              "faq_desc_4": "No, please note that CLUG cannot hang your bike, it doesn't work that way. CLUG works with your floor to store your bike. That said CLUG has been used by the likes of Schwalbe and Profile Design to store spare wheels neatly and accessibly.",
              "faq_question_5": "Can you use two CLUG’s to store the bike off the ground?",
              "faq_desc_5": "Sadly not! CLUGs don't work that way. CLUGs are made to work with your floor to store your bike. You should use one only CLUG per bike.",
              "faq_question_6": "Do I need two CLUGs - for the front and back wheels?",
              "faq_desc_6": "No! 1 CLUG does the job just fine.",
              "faq_question_7": "What sizes are there?",
              "faq_desc_7": "We have made five different sizes to fit tyres starting from 23mm (1”) all the way up to 81mm (3.2”). The five sizes are: roadie, hybrid, mtb, mtb XL, and plus. Have a look on our CLUG page to work out which size CLUG you need. If your tyre states its 2.3” or 2.4” then it will very likely have an actual size of around 2.2” and we strongly recommend you opt for the CLUG mtb size.",
              "faq_question_8": "I ordered a CLUG using your measurement guidelines for actual tyre width but it looks too small for my tyre?",
              "faq_desc_8": "If your tyre is at the top of the width range that your CLUG size accommodates, you will need to mount the CLUG to the wall in order to have enough pressure behind the bike to push the tyre into it.  Not an easy feat with CLUG in hand! A tight fit is a secure fit, but if you’re not sure please contact us at info@thehornit.com and we’ll be able to advise you whether or not you need to swap it for a larger size CLUG.",
              "faq_question_9": "Can I save space by clugging my bikes alternately ‘one front wheel up one front wheel down’?",
              "faq_desc_9": "No, you cannot clug vertically with the front wheel on the ground. It MUST be the back wheel on the ground, otherwise gravity will cause your handlebars to twist and the bike will fall down. However, you can save space by storing big bikes next to small bikes, alternately. Just be careful not to accidentally knock either of the adjacent bikes.",
              "faq_question_10": "I can’t drill into my wall. Would tape work?",
              "faq_desc_10": "Unfortunately tape won’t work as it is not strong enough. We do however have a Vacuum Mount launching in in the new year, which may be able to help if your wall surface is smooth. Keep an eye out on @thehornit Instagram page.",
              "faq_question_11": "Can I use the CLUG to store my e-bike?",
              "faq_desc_11": "CLUG is officially tested on bikes up to 13kg for the roadie and 20kg for all the other sizes. E-bikes tend to be 25kg so we cannot officially recommend it. Unofficially, if your e-bike tyre is an mtb tyre and is towards the upper end of the size range for the CLUG then it will be fine as there is a lot of friction holding it in place.",
              "faq_question_12": "Will CLUG cause damage to carbon fibre rims?",
              "faq_desc_12": "Good question! Basically CLUG will mark your carbon rims if the plastic touches the rim (which obviously none of us want to happen). To solve this, set the CLUG a couple of inches higher than the mid-point of the wheel so that CLUG still fully grips the tyre, but the arms are not long enough to touch the carbon rim. It can be tricky to get absolutely right first time so may require you to re-drill the holes. We know this works because there is a wall of Argon 18 bikes displayed like in this way at the Argon 18 HQ!",
              "faq_question_13": "Is CLUG compatible with Clincher tyres?",
              "faq_desc_13": "CLUG was born before the advent of high end, wide carbon rims and straight-walled tyres. Usually CLUG pinches the narrow part of the tyre by the rim and the tyre fills the inner part of the CLUG, but with clinchers the tyre wall tends to be straight, not rounded. It still grips because clincher tyres are almost always at the upper end of the roadie parameters.\n\nOne word of caution, please be sure you do not have a slow puncture as it would be awful if CLUG let go. We will have a special (retro-fittable) strap launching early in 2021 for complete peace of mind.",
              "faq_question_14": "Can I store my bike vertically if my bike has hydraulic brakes?",
              "faq_desc_14": "Yes you can! Don't listen to the naysayers on this! Hydraulic brakes use liquid (either DOT fluid or mineral oil). The reason some people think this is an issue is because if there is air in the hydraulic brake system, it may cause soft brakes (meaning the brake lever can be pulled in all the way instead of having a firm and immediate response). \nHowever, the only reason this happens is if the brakes have not been properly bled, which potentially causes air bubbles in the hydraulic system. It is NOT the fault of the storage method or the brakes, but the fault of the person who bled the brakes poorly! Worst case should be that after a few pumps of the brakes the pressure will be back to normal again.\nStill not convinced? We are aware of some forum posts e.g. from someone who has multiple mountain bikes who claims that their brakes behave differently (depending on brand) even though they are all stored vertically in the same way using CLUG. In other words, it is possible that there are a few brake systems with lesser quality seals that don’t respond well, but for the vast majority it is no problem at all. Either the brakes need bleeding properly or a further explanation would be that the more expensive braking systems have better seals. Cheap brakes with poor seals may leak more readily whether hung horizontally or vertically.",
              "faq_question_15": "What if my tyre has a slow puncture?",
              "faq_desc_15": "CLUG works by gripping your tyre so punctures will cause CLUG to let go (especially for the roadie and hybrid sizes). For the mtb and plus sizes, as long as your tyre is not at the bottom end of the that the CLUG accommodates, then the tyre wall usually keeps its shape sufficiently for your bike to remain secure. We suggest that you check your tyres regularly to avoid this happening. We will have a special (retro-fittable) strap launching in Autumn\/Winter 2020 for long term storage and complete peace of mind.",
              "faq_question_16": "My tyre width is in the middle of two different sized CLUGS.  Which one should I go for?",
              "faq_desc_16": "Please remember to measure your ACTUAL tyre size as this may well vary significantly from the stated size. We recommend going for a tighter fit as your bike will be more secure. In particular, if your tyre states it’s a  2.3” or 2.4” tyre, then it will very likely have an actual size of around 2.2” and we strongly recommend you opt for the CLUG mtb size, not the CLUG mtb XL.",
              "faq_question_17": "Can CLUG stretch over time?",
              "faq_desc_17": "CLUGs are made from a composite plastic polymer which has a great memory. They are made to return to their original size\/shape when the tyre is removed so this is not a problem you will have. The only scenario this might be an issue is if you store 27-32mm tyres in a CLUG roadie for a long time then switch to 23mm tyres.",
              "faq_question_18": "I’m planning on buying a new bike, can I move my CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_18": "Yes! If you are planning on drilling into anything that isn’t wood, you will need to get some new wall plugs. All you need to do is take out the plastic gripper that is covering the screws and unscrew the clipper. If you are drilling straight into wood then you wouldn’t need to find new wall plugs, you can just unscrew the screws and use them again.",
              "faq_question_19": "I’ve bought the wrong size CLUG. Can I return \/ exchange it?",
              "faq_desc_19": "If you email us at info@thehornit.com, we will gladly help you to sort out an exchange.",
              "faq_question_20": "My rear wheel is dirtying my wall, how can I prevent this from happening?",
              "faq_desc_20": "All good things come to those who wait. We’ve designed a wipe clean, re-usable mud pad that we expect to launch in the early 2021. The special micro-suction pad can be removed and re-used and won't pull off your paint.",
              "faq_question_21": "Can I rely on the tyre size stated on the tyre?",
              "faq_desc_21": "Sadly not! Road tyre stated sizes do tend to be accurate. However, when it comes to MTB tyres manufacturers almost always exaggerate the size by as much as 0.1-0.2”. This is why you should go by ACTUAL tyre size, not the stated tyre size, especially if you are at the upper or lower limit of a given CLUG size. In practice if a tyre is stated to be 2.3-2.4” it will probably measure 2.1-2.25”. This means that you should definitely go for the CLUG mtb (rather than the CLUG mtb XL) to ensure a snug fit – the mtb XL will be loose. See this short video on how to measure tyre width if you don't have callipers to hand.",
              "faq_question_22": "Can I mount CLUG on drywall?",
              "faq_desc_22": "If you have a roadie or hybrid size, the answer is yes you can. Please use the patented Toggler wall plugs supplied. We go to great lengths to source these from the USA as they are the best we have found. If you have the mtb, mtb XL or the plus size then the answer is no. The reason is that larger, ‘nobblier’ mountain bike tyres exert a much greater pull force on the CLUG and the dry wall is unlikely to cope.",
              "faq_question_23": "Can I mount CLUG at an angle?",
              "faq_desc_23": "You can if you are a DIY guru! You need to create an attachment between the wall and CLUG at the required angle and don’t forget to make a block for your bottom tyre to rest against at the same angle. Please note the tyre must fit into the CLUG straight on and not at an angle to be effective.",
              "faq_question_24": "How do I fit my CLUG?",
              "faq_desc_24": "Decide whether you want to clug vertically or horizontally. The CLUG should always sit just above (say 25mm or 1”) the centre line of the wheel. When clugging vertically this helps keep your handlebars straight. When clugging horizontally this will help make your bike more stable. Use the drilling guide on the box to drill two holes in the right place. We designed this specially for you and the box will even catch the dust as you drill! Using the screws provided screw the clipper into the holes that you have just made. Then fit the gripper inside the clipper."

              "faq_desc_1": "The Hornit dB140 is 140 decibels making it the world’s loudest bike horn!",
              "faq_question_2": "Why is it so loud?",
              "faq_desc_2": "It’s simple. The louder the horn the safer you are: the louder the horn the further away and the more quickly you get a motorist’s or a pedestrian’s attention and the more likely it is to be effective in all road conditions (diesel engines, tyre noise, wind...). And once they know you’re there they won't pull out or step out in front of you. All vehicles in the world have a horn by law because it makes drivers and pedestrians safer and yet for some reason the most vulnerable road user of all has historically had to make do with a bell. Being armed with a loud horn ironically makes cycling far less stressful as you know you can make yourself heard when it really matters, fewer road users get in your way, you have to brake less and you don’t have to shout at people.",
              "faq_question_3": "Why does it have two different sounds?",
              "faq_desc_3": "The piercing duo-tone sound is designed to be heard through car windows and above the ambient noise. The secondary car-horn 'park mode' sound it more of a traditional ‘beep’ sound which is less audible on the road but works much better for pedestrians in a park or on a trail. You change the sound mode by pressing the “H” button at the rear of the main unit.",
              "faq_question_4": "Why does one of the sounds on the dB140 sound like a tweeting bird?",
              "faq_desc_4": "Some trail riders and mountain bikers have said that the piercing 140dB sound actually sounds like a tweeting bird when they’re riding off-road. On the road it alerts drivers and pedestrians perfectly – they hear a noise and look\/cease the dangerous manoeuvre they are about to carry out because sub-consciously they know they are doing something that’s potentially dangerous. However, in a forest or on a trail, walkers sub-consciously are in their own safe worlds and the piercing mode at a distance can sound like a tweeting bird. For that reason, it’s much better to switch to the car-horn mode as pedestrians will associate the ‘beep’ sound with a vehicle will therefore be much more likely to look round and move out of your way.",
              "faq_question_5": "How do pedestrians react?",
              "faq_desc_5": "The great thing about the Hornit dB140 is that you can warn pedestrians a long way in advance. Pedestrians often use their ears as much as their eyes to cross a roads (especially if they are crossing a quiet road), but sub-consciously they are aware that they are potentially in danger. Therefore hearing a piercing sound will immediately cause them to look up and see you. If you alert a pedestrian in advance they can simply continue crossing or step back to let you pass without you having to brake or swerve. If you use a quiet bell or quiet horn or warn them too late, then the pedestrian will likely not look up until you are virtually on top of them and that’s when they freeze and\/or step into your way. It’s helpful to remember that the Hornit is not actually that loud when the sound reaches the pedestrian’s ears so don’t be afraid to use it in advance, giving them time to look up, see you and move calmly out of the way – it won't come across as aggressive. That said, you should always be prepared for a pedestrian not to move as you expect and ride accordingly.",
              "faq_question_6": "Can I use a New Style Trigger with an Old Style unit?",
              "faq_desc_6": "Unfortunately, an old style unit will only work with old style triggers and vice versa. We updated it to improve reliability. If you have any questions please email us at info@thehornit.com and we will gladly help you out.",
              "faq_question_7": "Is it legal?",
              "faq_desc_7": "Yes. There are currently no restrictions governing noise levels of horns on bicycles in the UK, USA, Australia or any of the other 44 countries we distribute our products in. Very few countries have legislated in this area with the exception of Germany. If you have a Hornit dB140 in Germany then be sure to use it off-road only. For some anomalous reason this wonderfully pro-cycling nation has an antiquated law that only bike bells may be used. We are lobbying Angel Merkel.",
              "faq_question_8": "Is it safe for my ears?",
              "faq_desc_8": "Yes. The sound of the dB140 is mainly projected forwards. Cyclists will only hear ~100-104dB when in use (which is about the same as going to a rock concert for a few seconds). Clearly it is up to the rider to use the Hornit responsibly and to weigh up the risks of having a crash against any possible ear drum damage.",
              "faq_question_9": "Is it safe for children to use?",
              "faq_desc_9": "The dB140 is not a toy and riders under the age of 16 should not use the Hornit due to their more sensitive ears and the increased likelihood of irresponsible use. That said, we strongly believe in letting people decide what risks they want to take so if your child is cycling to school and has to ride on a busy road then we would regard it to be as essential as using a helmet: preventing an accident altogether is preferable to having your head protected in an accident you could have avoided had you been able to warn another road user you were there! For young children we have our award winning Hornit Mini and Hornit Nano which are made for fun riding!",
              "faq_question_10": "How do I know it will fit my bike?",
              "faq_desc_10": "Our dB140 fit almost every bike. In fact in 10 years no one has ever said their Hornit dB140 is incompatible with their bike. The trigger is made of a durable stretchy rubber strap which fits around normal handlebars. The main mount unit with its rubber strap allows you to mount the horn in an easy and convenient position on your handlebars. Have a look at our instructions (which are also available online) if you want to look into it further. If you get your dB140 and it doesn’t fit, please contact us and we will help you further.",

              "faq_desc_11": "The dB140 is the same as any other valuable bike accessory and can get stolen, so please take the main horn unit with you when you park up. It’s fine to disconnect and leave the trigger on your bike. We cannot guarantee it, but the chances of someone taking a lone wire are negligible.",
              "faq_question_12": "How is it powered?",
              "faq_desc_12": "The dB140 is powered by 2 AAA Batteries should last you for up to 18 months with “normal use”. We consider “normal use” to be 6 x 1 second blasts a day 5 days a week. In practice you’re very unlikely to use it this often. It is very easy to change the batteries, simply unscrew the battery cover, change the batteries and screw the cover back on.",
              "faq_question_13": "Are the batteries included?",
              "faq_desc_13": "Yes. We include batteries with all of our products.",
              "faq_question_14": "Can I use rechargeable batteries?",
              "faq_desc_14": "Unfortunately, rechargeable batteries typically have a lower voltage, meaning that less sound is generated. However, battery technology is changing all the time so it’s fine to test and see whether there’s a difference in the sound. If you are looking for a rechargeable horn, have a look at our Hornit Lite.",
              "faq_question_15": "Is it waterproof?",
              "faq_desc_15": "Our Hornit dB140 is water resistant and is tested to work even in torrential rain. The IP rating is IP44. If you live in a humid climate we suggest you take it indoors with you to help prevent moisture getting inside over time. It is not 100% waterproof because water will get into the battery cover if it is submerged or mounted upside down.",

We strongly recommend the piercing mode or the whistle when riding in traffic. We’d recommend the car horn sound or whistle when riding on a trail or footpath.\nPiercing Mode at 120dB\nHigh Pitch at 112dB\nWhistle at 114dB\nBeep Beep at 95dB\nCar Horn at 101dB",
              "faq_question_4": "Is it legal?",
              "faq_desc_4": "Yes. There are currently no restrictions governing noise levels of horns on bicycles in the UK, USA, Australia or any of the other 44 countries we distribute our products in. Very few countries have legislated in this area with the exception of Germany. If you have a Hornit dB140 in Germany then be sure to use it off-road only. For some anomalous reason this wonderfully pro-cycling nation has an antiquated law that only bike bells may be used. We are lobbying Angel Merkel.",
              "faq_question_5": "Is it safe for my ears?",
              "faq_desc_5": "Yes. The sound of the dB140 is mainly projected downwards. Cyclists will only hear ~94-98dB when in use (which is about the same as going to a rock concert and standing at the back for a few seconds). Clearly it is up to the rider to use the Hornit responsibly and to weigh up the risks of having a crash against any possible ear drum damage.",
              "faq_question_6": "Is it safe for my ears?",
              "faq_desc_6": "Yes. The sound of the dB140 is mainly projected downwards.

              "faq_question_7": "Is it safe for children to use?",
              "faq_desc_7": "The Hornit LITE is not a toy and riders under the age of 16 should not use the Hornit LITE due to their more sensitive ears and the increased likelihood of irresponsible use. That said, we strongly believe in letting people decide what risks they want to take so if your child is cycling to school and has to ride on a busy road then we would regard it to be as essential as using a helmet: preventing an accident altogether is preferable to having your head protected in an accident you could have avoided had you been able to warn another road user you were there! For young children we have our award winning Hornit Mini and Hornit Nano.",
              "faq_question_8": "How do I know it will fit my bike?",
              "faq_desc_8": "Hornit LITE will fit the majority of bikes as the trigger is made of a durable stretchy rubber strap which fits around normal handlebars. The main unit allows you to mount the horn in an easy and convenient position on your handlebars. Have a look at our instructions (which are also available online) if you want to look into it further. If you get your LITE and it doesn’t fit, please Contact US and we can help you further.",
              "faq_question_9": "Will it get stolen?",
              "faq_desc_9": "The LITE is the same as any other valuable bike accessory and can get stolen, so please take the whole unit with you when you park up.",
              "faq_question_10": "How is it powered?",
              "faq_desc_10": "The Hornit LITE is our uses a 1,200 mAh Li-Po battery which is micro USB rechargeable. Simply plug it in for 90 minutes and once fully charged can be used for up to 9 hours 30 mins hours of run time.",
              "faq_question_11": "Is it waterproof?",
              "faq_desc_11": "The LITE is water resistant and is tested to work in torrential rain and high humidity. The IP rating is IP44. If you live in a humid climate we suggest you take it indoors with you to help prvent moisture from getting inside over time. It is not 100% waterproof as water can get in if fully submerged.",
              "faq_question_12": "Can I buy one in the shops?",
              "faq_desc_12": "Yes. You can find the Hornit dB140 in all good cycle stores in the UK and abroad.",

In addition, the Hornit Mini is toy-tested to make it safe for children’s sensitive ears. The Hornit Mini isn’t made for safety when cycling or scootering on main roads.

              "faq_desc_3": "This clearly varies depending on use. The 2x AAA batteries last for up to 7 hours on a constant light mode and up to 12 hours on flashing mode. This is less than the Nano because at 12 lumens the Mini is brighter.",

              "faq_question_6": "Why is there an optional remote trigger?",
              "faq_desc_6": "On a scooter, the child’s hands are much closer together and so a remote trigger isn’t normally needed for their thumbs to safely reach the buttons. However, on a bike, it’s rarely easy to mount the Hornit Mini next to their hands so the trigger enables them to make the selected sound safely (without having to take their hands off the handlebars).",

              "faq_desc_9": "We know that the combination of the cycling and toy environments mean our products have to be strong. The wings are tested to withstand a dead weight of 10kg weight on them so to break them you have to really want to! That said, rubber can tear easily if it comes into contact with a sharp object so take care to avoid nicks or cuts on the wings.",

              "faq_desc_10": "The ‘sting’ button at the rear of the Mini Hornit is the volume button.\nTo change the volume, press the sting. The volume cycles through from loud to medium to quiet and round again. The volume setting you are on is indicated by the loudness of the beep sound it makes each time you press it.",

We have a ring adjuster at the back of the helmet (with an integrated LED light) which tightens and loosens to ensure the helmet fits snuggly to you’re the rider’s head. The straps that clip under the chin are also adjustable. The ring adjuster should be tightened until the fit is firm, but comfortable and the chin strap should fit snugly under the chin.",

              "faq_desc_5": "No. If the helmet has suffered an impact (even if there is no visible damage), or when it shows obvious signs of wear and tear, you should discard and replace it.

              "faq_desc_1": "Our Hornit AIRO is available in one size and includes an adjustable seat post which means the AIRO can grow as your child does. The AIRO is suitable for a child with an inside leg measurement of 38-52cm (approximately 18 months to 5 years).",
              "faq_question_2": "How high should the seat be?",
              "faq_desc_2": "The seat height should be adjusted so that when the child is sitting on the seat with their feet flat on the ground, they have slight bend in the knees. For long-distance striding on smooth surfaces, you can raise this slightly. For obstacles, tricks, and off-road riding, the saddle should be adjusted for slightly more bend in the knees.",
              "faq_question_3": "What are the tyres made from?",
              "faq_desc_3": "Quality is important to us. That’s why we use proper air-filled rubber tyres for a super smooth riding experience (rather than cheap solid foam tyres which make for an uncomfortable ride).",
              "faq_question_4": "What should the tyre pressure be?",
              "faq_desc_4": "Maintaining the correct tyre pressure will help to extend the life of your tyres, improve safety and ensure a smooth ride. For the hawk-eyed amongst you there is a typo in the instructions you received with your AIRO!\nBoth the front and back tyres on the Hornit AIRO should be inflated to 20-30 PSI (1.5-2.0 BAR)",
              "faq_question_5": "Why are there no tyre valve caps?",
              "faq_desc_5": "The Hornit AIRO has been toy safety tested for a child of 18 months+ and so the valve caps had to be removed in accordance with the EN71 toy regulations as they present a choking hazard.",

              "faq_desc_7": "The standard frame and forks warranty is 3 years from the date of purchase. You can upgrade to a lifetime warranty for the frame forks by registering at hornit.com\/register-warranty using your order number. The warranty applies only when the product is used as intended, under normal conditions and does not apply to damage caused by wear and tear, accidents, corrosive substances, water, misuse or neglect. Lifetime means for as long as the original purchaser owns the bike.",

              "faq_question_9": "Why is there no brake?",
              "faq_desc_9": "Brakes are a divisive issue! The reality is that a brake is a totally alien concept to a 18 month to 3 year old and they won’t use it even if you tell them to. They will use their feet. We debated at length whether to have one (essentially to make the parents feel better), but resisted because it gives parents a false sense of security, ironically making the child less safe. Ideally balance bikes should not be used anywhere where brakes are needed and not having a brake makes that more likely.",
              "faq_question_10": "Which way round should the forks be?",
              "faq_desc_10": "Getting the forks the right way round on your AIRO is important. The thick line decal on the side of the fork should be at the front of the bike.",
              "faq_question_11": "Handlebars grinding?",
              "faq_desc_11": "It means you have over-tightened the top cap bolt. Remove the protective neoprene cover and use the Allen key provided to tighten the top cap bolt. Be careful not to over-tighten as it should not restrict the steering: the handlebars should still turn smoothly. Overtightening will damage the bearings.",
